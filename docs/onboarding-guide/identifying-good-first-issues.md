# Start Contributing to AsyncAPI
Welcome to the AsyncAPI community! Not sure where to make your first contribution? This guide is a treasure map to help you navigate the process, find the right issues, and get started with contributing to AsyncAPI.

## Your First Contribution
### Find Something to Work On
The first step in contributing to AsyncAPI is identifying an issue to work on. Contributions come in many forms, and every contribution, big or small, matters! Here are a few ways to get started:

- Improve the documentation (fix typos, enhance explanations, add examples).

- Clarify code comments, improve variable names, or refactor code.

- Add test coverage for untested areas.

- Help triage issues (identify duplicates, provide additional context).

If none of the above resonate with you, check out issues labeled `"good first issue"` or `"help wanted"` in the repositories. These labels indicate tasks that are well-scoped for new contributors.

>‚ö† Note: While all contributions are welcome, each pull request requires review and testing from maintainers. Please avoid unnecessary PRs (like fixing minor linter warnings, single-character typos or reformatting) unless they add real value. Always communicate with maintainers before making such changes.


## How to Find Good First Issues
Imagine you're a detective searching for clues. In open-source, your clues are GitHub issues‚Äî tasks that need solving. Some issues are complex mysteries, while others are simple puzzles that are perfect for beginners.

### Look for "Good First Issue" Labels
GitHub repositories often label issues to indicate difficulty levels. For beginners, the best ones to start with are:

- good first issue ‚Äì These are beginner-friendly and usually come with clear instructions.
- help wanted ‚Äì These issues need attention, but may require a bit more effort.

### How to Find These Issues:
1.  Go to the [AsyncAPI repository](https://github.com/asyncapi) you‚Äôre interested in, like [`AsyncAPI Generator`](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator).
2. Click on the "Issues" tab .
3. Use the search bar to filter beginner-friendly issues:

```bash
label:"good first issue" is:open
```
or

```bash
label:"help wanted" is:open
```
4. Read through the issue descriptions and pick one that interests you.
This is like a video game where "Good First Issues" are Level 1 quests‚Äî easy enough for beginners but still important for the game progression!

### Next Steps
AsyncAPI follows a "first come, first served" approach for issue assignment:

- Comment on the issue ‚Äì Start with saying something like, "Hey, I‚Äôd like to work on this!" so maintainers know you're interested.
- We do not pre-assign issues. Instead, contributors must comment on an issue they want to work on.
- Once you comment, wait for approval by maintainers. They may guide you further (if needed) or might assign the issue to you. If there are no blockers, you can start working!
- Start coding! ‚Äì Once approved, fork the repository, create a new branch, and start working!
- Ask for help ‚Äì Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask in the issue comments or the dedicated AsyncAPI Slack Channel if you‚Äôre stuck.

So what are you waiting for? Go find your first quest, and let‚Äôs build something awesome together!
